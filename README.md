# Snake AI
I created the __PERFECT__ Snake AI using the A* pathfinding algorithm! This algorithm works by finding the longest possible path between the snake's head and snake's tail. The apple is always on this path and it is eaten as the snake travels on this path. The snake is also never trapped as the snake's body leaves a way out for the snake's head. This program usually take 1 hour to run. Feel free to use my code!

Disclaimer:

I have run the AI ten times and it has worked perfectly but I can't be too sure if it is absolutely perfect.
