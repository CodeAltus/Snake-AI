# Snake AI
I created the __PERFECT__ Snake AI using the A* pathfinding algorithm! 

## Implementation
The A* pathfinding algorithm was used to find the longest possible path between the snake's head and snake's tail. The apple is always on this path and it is eaten as the snake travels on this path. The snake is also never trapped as the snake's body leaves a way out for the snake's head. This program usually takes 1 hour to run.

## Demo
You can see my Snake AI in action at https://codealtus.github.io/Snake-AI/

## Disclaimer

I have run the AI ten times and it has worked perfectly but I can't be too sure if it is absolutely perfect. Feel free to use my code!
